Position Auction With Platform’s Intervention”, in preparation for submission.

<summary>Abstract</summary><sub>
We study a position auction problem with intervention. Finding the optimal mechanism is NP-Hard, while a simple mechanism provides a tight constant bound. The non-trivial impact of intervention on the allocation and payment rules is studied.

<summary>Abstract</summary><sub>
We propose a sequential recommendation-selection model where a seller recommends sets of products to consumers over multiple stages. consumers are heterogeneous in the patience levels, characterized by a certain number of stages that a consumer is willing to go through when making a purchase. Consumers view the products stage by stage. If a consumer can find a satisfactory product before exhausting her patience, she will purchase the product and leave the system immediately. Otherwise, the consumer stays till the last stage within her patience level but ends up without purchasing. The seller’s objective is to maximize his expected overall revenue by optimizing the recommendation sequence or the products’ prices. We note that the seller can learn the consumers’ patience levels as well as their utilities through the recommendation process, and thus can adjust his future recommendations accordingly. However, a static sequential recommendation strategy would suffice. Therefore, we derive a set of results: 1) For the pure recommendation order problem, the optimal solution possesses a sequential revenue-ordered property, which can be efficiently discovered by dynamic programming. We also find that a crude heuristic – only offering one set of products at a single stage – will earn a tight 50% of the optimal revenue. 2) In the single-leg dynamic capacity control problem, the optimal recommendations admit an inclusion property. 3) The optimal pricing policy under a fixed recommendation order is unique, which can be efficiently found by a binary search. 4) However, the joint recommendation and pricing problem is NP-hard, while recommending all products only at a single stage and optimizing their prices accordingly will earn a tight 88% of the optimal revenue.</sub>

<summary>Abstract</summary><sub>
Many innovative products are designed to satisfy the demand of specific target consumers, and thus innovators with new products will inevitably compete with each other in the post-innovation market. We investigate how should a profit-maximizing principal properly allocate her limited resources to support the innovations of multiple potentially competing innovators. We find that as the available resources increase, the number of agents receiving resources may first increase and then decrease. This interesting nonmonotone pattern is driven by a trade-off between the risk of innovation failure and rent dissipation due to competition. The results are robust to incorporating an endogenous profit-sharing rule and costly resources. Using the framework, we also analyze a nonprofit principal seeking to maximize the total number of successful innovations, the probability of at least one innovator succeeding, consumer surplus, and total social welfare.</sub>

We consider two business models for a two-sided economy under uncertainty: dealership and marketplace. Although both business models can bridge the gap between demand and supply, it is not clear which model is better for the firm or for the consumers. We show that while the two models differ substantially in pricing power, inventory risk, fee structure, and fulfillment time, both models share several important features, with the revenues to the firm from the two models converging when the markets are thick. We also show that for thick markets there is a one-to-one mapping between their corresponding optimal policies. We provide guidelines and insights as to which business model is preferable under different conditions when the markets are not thick.</sub>
