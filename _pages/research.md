   Live-streaming e-commerce has been emerging as a new trend of online shopping. Amazon and Alibaba both embrace this novel marketing tool to engage customers by sequentially demonstrating different products for choice. In this paper, we use a mechanism design framework to demonstrate how the live-streaming platform can leverage information provision to improve its advertisement revenue from traditional position auctions. We show that the revenue loss from neglecting information intervention can be arbitrarily large. However, solving for the optimal mechanism is NP-hard. We thus develop a heuristic that guarantees a revenue at least as half as the optimal one. At last, we show that with information intervention, a more profitable seller may be allocated a lower position, whose per-click payment can also be lower.

We  develop  a  variant  of  the  multinomial  logit  model  with  impatient  customers  and  study  assortment optimization and pricing problems under this choice model. In our choice model, a customer incrementally views the assortment of available products in multiple stages. The patience level of a customer determines the maximum number of stages in which she is willing to view the assortments of products. In each stage, if the utility of a product in the current stage is larger than a minimum acceptable utility, which we refer to as the utility of the outside option, then the customer purchases the product right away. Otherwise, the customer views the assortment of products in the next stage, as long as her patience level allows her to do so. Under the assumption that the utilities have the Gumbel distribution and are independent, we give a closed-form expression for the choice probabilities. For the assortment optimization problem, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm for finding the revenue-maximizing sequence of assortments to offer. For the pricing problem, we show that if the sequence of offered assortments is fixed, then we can solve a convex program to find the revenue-maximizing prices, where the decision variables are the probabilities that a customer will reach different stages. We build on this result to give a 0.878-approximation algorithm, when both the prices and the sequence of assortments are decision variables. We also consider the assortment optimization problem when  each  product  occupies  some  space  and  there  is  a  constraint  on  the  total  space  consumption  of  the offered products. We give a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for this constrained problem. We use a dataset from Expedia to demonstrate that incorporating patience levels, as in our model, can improve purchase predictions. We also check the effectiveness of our approximation schemes.

The Order Protect Rule in the U.S. generally prohibits any trade-through, i.e., a market order that is not executed at the best possible price among fast (i.e. electronic and automated) trading venues. We conduct a counterfactual analysis comparing the order execution costs of a liquidity demander when trade-through is allowed versus prohibited. By deriving upper and lower bounds for the costs, we find that the trade-through benefit is marginal for small trades and stocks with fast resilience. In particular, our study suggests that the current separate regulations for fast and slow venues may be extended to differentiate stocks with fast and slow resilience speeds.</sub>

Many innovative products are designed to satisfy the demand of specific target consumers, and thus innovators with new products will inevitably compete with each other in the post-innovation market. We investigate how should a profit-maximizing principal properly allocate her limited resources to support the innovations of multiple potentially competing innovators. We find that as the available resources increase, the number of agents receiving resources may first increase and then decrease. This interesting nonmonotone pattern is driven by a trade-off between the risk of innovation failure and rent dissipation due to competition. The results are robust to incorporating an endogenous profit-sharing rule and costly resources. Using the framework, we also analyze a nonprofit principal seeking to maximize the total number of successful innovations, the probability of at least one innovator succeeding, consumer surplus, and total social welfare.</sub>

We consider two business models for a two-sided economy under uncertainty: dealership and marketplace. Although both business models can bridge the gap between demand and supply, it is not clear which model is better for the firm or for the consumers. We show that while the two models differ substantially in pricing power, inventory risk, fee structure, and fulfillment time, both models share several important features, with the revenues to the firm from the two models converging when the markets are thick. We also show that for thick markets there is a one-to-one mapping between their corresponding optimal policies. We provide guidelines and insights as to which business model is preferable under different conditions when the markets are not thick.</sub>

<summary>Abstract</summary><sub>
Exponential bandits are widely used in modelling projects selection in economics. In this paper, we study an operational problem based on this framework, in which a player dyanmically chooses from a finite number of projects with dependent or independent states. We obtain a set of results. 1) An index theorem is proposed to choose the optimal project based on the current belief of states.  2) When information acquisition is available, it may be used in the middle stage or as a last-ditch effort before quitting. 3) With a discount factor, each project may be used multiple times, while the number of which is bounded up by a defined index. 4) When the states of projects are negatively correlated, the player may adopt a static hedging policy by implementing more than one projects simultaneously, while the number of such policies is bounded up.

<summary>Abstract</summary><sub>
A platform recommends a product from a set of horizontally differentiated ones sold by a single retailer to heterogeneous customers. To ease customer privacy concerns, the recommendation needs to satisfy a privacy constraint, which prevents direct exploitation of individual customer’s true preference. We show that for a fixed product price the optimal recommendation policy has a simple threshold structure: all products ranked before a threshold in the customer preference list are recommended with a uniform high probability and all products ranked after the threshold are recommended with a uniform low probability. We conduct asymptotic analysis to explore the impact of privacy protection on the efficiency and effectiveness of recommendation when the number of products is sufficiently large. At last, we show that stringent privacy protections can be detrimental to all market participants even when the retailer can respond by adjusting the product price.

<summary>Abstract</summary><sub>
We develop a complete theory for symmetry protected non-Abelian statistics of Majorana Kramers' pairs (MKPs) in time-reversal (TR) invariant topological superconductors, with fundamental results being uncovered. By introducing an effective Hamiltonian approach to describe the braiding of MKPs, we show that the non-Abelian braiding is protected when the effective Hamiltonian exhibits a new TR-like antiunitary symmetry, which is satisfied if the system is free of dynamical noise. Importantly, even the dynamical noise cannot cause error in braiding, unless the noise correlation function breaks a dynamical TR symmetry. This is a profound result and generalizes the TR symmetry protection of MKPs to the dynamical regime. Moreover, the resulted error by noise is shown to be a higher-order effect, compared with the decoherence of Majorana qubits without TR symmetry protection. This study completes the theory of symmetry-protected non-Abelian statistics of MKPs, and shows that the non-Abelian braiding of MKPs is well observable and may have versatile applications to future quantum computation technologies.

Don't worry about the overall importance of the problem; work on it if it looks interesting. 

I think there's a sufficient correlation between interest and importance.
