A mechanism design perspective of live-streaming commerce: the role of information intervetion”, in preparation for submission.

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary><sub>
We model the live streamer's problem as a mechanism design problem with information intervention. Finding the optimal mechanism is NP-Hard, while a simple mechanism provides a tight constant bound. The non-trivial impact of intervention on the allocation and payment rules is studied.

We  develop  a  variant  of  the  multinomial  logit  model  with  impatient  customers  and  study  assort mentoptimization and pricing problems under this choice model. In our choice model, a customer incrementally views the assortment of available products in multiple stages. The patience level of a customer determines the maximum number of stages in which she is willing to view the assortments of products. In each stage, if theu tility of a product in the current stage is larger than a minimum acceptable utility, which we refer to as the utility of the outside option, then the customer purchases the product right away. Otherwise, the customer views the assortment of products in the next stage, as long as her patience level allows her to do so. Underthe assumption that the utilities have the Gumbel distribution and are independent, we give a closed-form expression for the choice probabilities. For the assortment optimization problem, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm for finding the revenue-maximizing sequence of assortments to offer. For the pricing problem,we show that if the sequence of offered assortments is fixed, then we can solve a convex program to findthe revenue-maximizing prices, where the decision variables are the probabilities that a customer will reach different stages. We build on this result to give a 0.878-approximation algorithm, when both the prices andthe sequence of assortments are decision variables. We also consider the assortment optimization problem when  each  product  occupies  some  space  and  there  is  a  constraint  on  the  total  space  consumption  of  the offered products. We give a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for this constrained problem.Weuse a dataset from Expedia to demonstrate that incorporating patience levels, as in our model, can improve purchase predictions. We also check the effectiveness of our approximation schemes.

The Order Protect Rule in the U.S. generally prohibits any trade-through, i.e., a market order that is not executed at the best possible price among fast (i.e. electronic and automated) trading venues. We conduct a counterfactual analysis comparing the order execution costs of a liquidity demander when trade-through is allowed versus prohibited. By deriving upper and lower bounds for the costs, we find that the trade-through benefit is marginal for small trades and stocks with fast resilience. In particular, our study suggests that the current separate regulations for fast and slow venues may be extended to differentiate stocks with fast and slow resilience speeds.</sub>

Many innovative products are designed to satisfy the demand of specific target consumers, and thus innovators with new products will inevitably compete with each other in the post-innovation market. We investigate how should a profit-maximizing principal properly allocate her limited resources to support the innovations of multiple potentially competing innovators. We find that as the available resources increase, the number of agents receiving resources may first increase and then decrease. This interesting nonmonotone pattern is driven by a trade-off between the risk of innovation failure and rent dissipation due to competition. The results are robust to incorporating an endogenous profit-sharing rule and costly resources. Using the framework, we also analyze a nonprofit principal seeking to maximize the total number of successful innovations, the probability of at least one innovator succeeding, consumer surplus, and total social welfare.</sub>

We consider two business models for a two-sided economy under uncertainty: dealership and marketplace. Although both business models can bridge the gap between demand and supply, it is not clear which model is better for the firm or for the consumers. We show that while the two models differ substantially in pricing power, inventory risk, fee structure, and fulfillment time, both models share several important features, with the revenues to the firm from the two models converging when the markets are thick. We also show that for thick markets there is a one-to-one mapping between their corresponding optimal policies. We provide guidelines and insights as to which business model is preferable under different conditions when the markets are not thick.</sub>

Don't worry about the overall importance of the problem; work on it if it looks interesting. 

I think there's a sufficient correlation between interest and importance.
