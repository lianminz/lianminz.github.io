I will become an assistant professor of the School of Data Science (SDS) at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. 

Currently, I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in  <a href="https://ieda.ust.hk/eng/index.php" target="_blank"><span style="color:black">Industrial Engineering and Decision Analytics</span></a>, HKUST.  I am very fortunate to be co-advised by  <a href="https://ieda.ust.hk/dfaculty/ggallego/" target="_blank"><span style="color:black">Guillermo Gallego</span></a> and <a href="http://individual.utoronto.ca/ningyuanchen/" target="_blank"><span style="color:black">Ningyuan Chen</span></a>.   Both my MPhil and BSc are majored in Theoretical Physics, and they are obtained from HKUST (2015) and Wuhan University (2013), respectively. During 2016 and 2017, I worked in industry as a business/data analyst. Currently, I also serve as a consultant for a transportation company. 

My research focuses on revenue management, especially in recommendation systems. I use various methodoligies to solve real-world problems, including dynamic programming, multi-armed bandits, online algorithms and mechanism design. Currently, I am very interested in algorithmic game theory, privacy preserving recommendations and causal inference.
