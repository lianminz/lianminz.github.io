I am a Ph.D. candidate in Industry Engineering & Decision Analytics at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. 

My supervisors are [<span style="color:blue">Guillermo Gallego</span>](https://ieda.ust.hk/dfaculty/ggallego/) and [<span style="color:blue">Ningyuan Chen</span>](http://individual.utoronto.ca/ningyuanchen/). 

Before pursuing a Ph.D. degree, I spent one year in a FinTech company and one year in a supply chain management company.  I received my MPhil in Theoretical Physics at HKUST in 2015.

## Research Interests

* Revenue management and pricing analytics
* Mechanism design
* Search models

I enjoy devising elegant but general models that provide efficient algorithms and important insights for real-world operational problems.
