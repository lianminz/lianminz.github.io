Personally, I evaluate my own or other articles from the following five aspects: 

|   |  |
|---| :---|
|**Story** |A hot topic in society？ **Novelty** of the story.|
|**Model**| Is the formulation **general**？ Is the model too complicated with too many factors? Does the simplication grasp the keys of the problem?|
|**Methodology** | How to solve the problem? Is it a **noval** approach? LP, dynamic stochastic control or mechanism design? Or an empirical study?|
|**Math**  |Is it a **hard** problem?|
|**Insight**| Propose an **algorithm**（bound, complexity)? **Simple and beautiful** mathematical results? **Counterintuive** findings?|
